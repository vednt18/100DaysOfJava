/**
 * Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!
 * Given an array, s,n of  real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin,
 * meaning that .1 is printed as .1, and 0.1 is printed as 0.1 If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values,
 * then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
